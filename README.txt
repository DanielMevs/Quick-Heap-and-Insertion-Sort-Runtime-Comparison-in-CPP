To run this program, go to visual studio, create a new project, name it runtime, make it a winApplication file
Unclick the Cycles option, and deselect the precompiled header and then click empty project
Then you want to go to wherever you have my folder saved/unzipped, and double click the file that says runtime.cpp
Then you build and run without debugging
That should run the code.
